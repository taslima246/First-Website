    <p>During the early 9th century the greater Chittagong area, 
        including Cox's Bazar, was under the rule of Arakan kings until 
        its conquest by the Mughals in 1666.[6] When the Mughal Prince Shah Shuja was 
        passing through the hilly terrain of the present-day Cox's Bazar on his way to 
        Arakan, he was attracted to its scenic and captivating beauty. He commanded his 
        forces to camp there. His retinue of one thousand palanquins stopped there for 
        some time. A place named Dulahazara, meaning "one thousand palanquins," 
        still exists in the area. After the Mughals, the place came under the control 
        of the Tipras and the Arakanese, followed by the Portuguese and then the British.
